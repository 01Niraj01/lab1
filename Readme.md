# Insert/Delete Row Table Lab

This project is a simple web application that allows users to insert a new row at the bottom or delete the top row of an HTML table using JavaScript.

## 💻 How to Use

- Open the `lab1.html` file in a web browser.
- Click **"Insert row"** to add a new row to the bottom of the table.
- Click **"Delete row"** to remove the top row from the table.

## 🗂️ Files

- `lab1.html`: Contains the full HTML structure and JavaScript functions for inserting and deleting rows.
  - 🔸 *Lines 12–18: JavaScript function `insertRowBottom()` was written with help from AI.*
  - 🔸 All HTML and structure created by me.

## 📚 Sources

- Some assistance was taken from ChatGPT for JavaScript syntax (specifically for `insertRowBottom()`).
- The rest of the logic, layout, and testing were done independently.
